### Description ðŸ”¥

Time Brush lets you filter a time-based data by directly dragging or brushing over a time period of interest.
The initial display is a helpful overview that shows the frequency of items in each pre-defined time bucket (e.g., hours, days, years) as a vertical bar chart.
Whenever you select a time period, any linked visuals are automatically filtered to display only those records with time attributes in the selected period.
